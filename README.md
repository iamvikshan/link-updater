  - 'rst'
  - 'txt'
```

### Selective Path Processing

## Security

This action requires a `GITHUB_TOKEN` with write permissions to update repository files. The token is automatically provided by GitHub Actions but needs to be explicitly passed to the action.

For security best practices:
- Only grant the minimum required permissions
- Be careful when using custom configuration files
- Review the link replacement patterns before deployment

## Acknowledgments

This action was inspired by the need to maintain consistent documentation and links across repositories.
