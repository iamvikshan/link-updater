        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
          create-pr: 'true'  # Optional, defaults to false
```

## Configuration Options

# Directories to process
paths:
  - 'docs'
  - 'src'
  - '.'

# File types to process
fileTypes:
  - 'md'
  - 'html'
  - 'txt'

# Regular link mappings (for non-GitHub URLs)

```

### Action Inputs

| Input         | Required | Default                   | Description                        |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

## Advanced Usage

### Using GitHub Context Variables

You can use GitHub context variables in your configuration:

```yaml
links:
  - old: 'https://github.com/old/repo'
    new: ${{ github.repository }}
  - old: 'https://example.com/docs'
    new: ${{ secrets.NEW_DOCS_URL }}

# Automatic GitHub URL processing
githubUrls:
  types:
    - 'username' # Will update any github.com/username references and only those, not the repo or sponsors
    - 'repo' # Will update any github.com/username/repo references
    - 'sponsors' # Will update any github.com/sponsors/username references
    # - 'all'     # Uncomment to update all GitHub URLs
```

### Multiple File Type Processing

Process different file types with specific patterns:

```yaml
fileTypes:
  - 'md'
  - 'mdx'
  - 'html'
  - 'rst'
  - 'txt'
```

### Selective Path Processing

Choose specific directories or files to process:

```yaml
paths:
  - 'docs' # Process entire docs directory
  - 'src/components' # Process specific subdirectory
  - 'README.md' # Process specific file
```

## Security

This action requires a `GH_TOKEN` with write permissions to update repository
files. The token is automatically provided by GitHub Actions but needs to be
explicitly passed to the action.

For security best practices:

- Only grant the minimum required permissions
- Be careful when using custom configuration files
- Review the link replacement patterns before deployment

## Acknowledgments

This action was inspired by the need to maintain consistent documentation and
links across repositories. You can say i am lazy but after forking repositories,
i have to update the links in the README.md file and i thought why not automate
this process. So here it is.
